# **Ndit:Powerful and lightweight editor made in javascript**

## **Project Overview**

**Ndit** was made with the main purpose to show to the rest of developers,
how powerful is javascript from the backend side, i've been searching an editor
made in javascript, but there's no one what works very well or stay up to date,
so i decided to make my own editor in javascript. Ndit is a minimalistic
text editor but i'd like to convert it in a more powerful code editor like
neovim, so if you wanna contribute with this project, just push your changes, it
would be a pleasure to work with you, please send me your ideas or something
that you think would help this project to evolve in something bigger.

## **Usage**
for now, Ndit just can be executed in local, compiling it from source,but
i have plans to release it in npm as a cli app in order to share the project.
if you wanna compile it from the source, you must follow the next steps after
you cloned the repository:

* install the dependencies
```javascript
npm i
```
* execute the build and start script:
```javascript
node --run  start
```
